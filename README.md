## What for?
SafeMyWork is intended for people who **handle a lot of files** which can be texts, images, songs... The aim is to **avoid losing** documents.

### GUI (Linux)

Run SafeMyWork and select your working folders. Then while you are working, every a certain amount of time, all files in this folder will be copied into a separate folder. It keeps your files safe if you forget to save your work or delete accidentally files.

It can also synchronize two folders.

### CLI (Linux & Windows)

*Command line interface*

Download the latest release here: <https://github.com/Thykof/SafeMyWork/releases>. Unzip.

#### Windows

Open a terminal window (`cmd.exe`) and type `cli.exe --help` to see how to use the command line interface.


#### Linux (Ubuntu)

Open a terminal window and type `cli --help` to see how to use the command line interface.

### Example

The command...

    cli -w /home/username/work-folder --extentions txt,pdf -t filter -d 5 --dirname .git -n 2 --dirpath build/classes

...will copie all files in `/home/username/work-folder` except the files ending with `txt` and `pdf`
and except the folders named `.git` and except the folder `build/classes` every 5 minutes and it will do this 2 times.
