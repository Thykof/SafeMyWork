## What for ?
SafeMyWork is intend for people who **handle lot of files** which can be texts, images, songs... The aim is to **avoid losing** documents.

Run SafeMyWork and select your working folders. Then while you are working, every a certain amount of time, all files in this folder will be copying into a separated folder. It keeps your files safe if you forget to save your work or delete accidentally files.

It can also synchronise two folders.
